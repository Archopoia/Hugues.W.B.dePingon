## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Option 1: Use the Template As-Is

1. Open `character-sheet-template.html` in your browser
2. Customize the content:
   - Change "YOUR NAME" to your name
   - Update attribute values (STR, DEX, INT, WIS)
   - Modify skill names and specialties
   - Edit the bio/background text
   - Update contact buttons
3. Adjust colors using CSS variables in `character-sheet-quick-reference.css`
4. Deploy to your hosting service

### Option 2: Build From Scratch

1. Start with your own HTML structure
2. Link `character-sheet-quick-reference.css`:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="character-sheet-quick-reference.css">
   ```
3. Use the classes from the quick reference:
   ```html
   <button class="btn-character-sheet">Click Me</button>
   <div class="attribute-card theme-red">
       <h3>Your Stat</h3>
   </div>
   ```
4. Refer to `character-sheet-design-analysis.md` for design principles
5. Check `character-sheet-template.html` for implementation examples

### Option 3: Extract Specific Components

Use `character-sheet-design-analysis.md` as a reference to understand specific components, then grab only the CSS classes you need from `character-sheet-quick-reference.css`.

## üé® Customization Guide

### Changing the Color Scheme

All colors are defined as CSS variables at the top of `character-sheet-quick-reference.css`:

```css
:root {
  /* Change these to customize your entire color scheme */
  --parchment-bg: #9c8e72;
  --text-dark: #4d3000;
  --red-theme: #643030;
  --yellow-theme: #776c48;
  --green-theme: #567251;
  --teal-theme: #517c78;
  /* ... etc */
}
```

**Example:** For a darker, gothic theme:
```css
:root {
  --parchment-bg: #2a2520;
  --text-dark: #ffffff;
  --red-theme: #8b0000;
  --yellow-theme: #c9a11f;
}
```

### Changing Fonts

Replace the Google Fonts import at the top of the CSS:

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=YourFont&display=swap');

* {
  font-family: 'YourFont', cursive;
}
```

### Adjusting Animation Speeds

Change the transition speed variable:

```css
:root {
  --transition-speed: 0.4s; /* Make faster: 0.2s, slower: 0.8s */
}
```

### Removing the Background Texture

In your CSS, comment out or remove:

```css
body {
  /* background-image: url("..."); */
  background-color: var(--parchment-bg);
}
```

## üîß Technical Notes

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) fully supported
- Uses CSS Grid (IE11 not supported)
- Custom scrollbars work in Chrome/Edge/Safari (fallback in Firefox)

### Performance
- Animations use `transform` and `opacity` for GPU acceleration
- Box shadows can be intensive; reduce layers on low-end devices if needed

### Accessibility
- Maintain high contrast ratios when changing colors
- Ensure interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Add ARIA labels for screen readers where appropriate

### Responsive Design
- Template includes basic mobile breakpoints
- Adjust grid columns for smaller screens
- Consider reducing animation complexity on mobile

## üìñ Learning Path

1. **Start by viewing:** Open `character-sheet-template.html` in a browser
2. **Understand the design:** Read `character-sheet-design-analysis.md` sections 1-10
3. **Customize the template:** Edit the HTML content while keeping the structure
4. **Experiment with colors:** Modify CSS variables in the quick reference
5. **Add your own components:** Reference the analysis for patterns
6. **Deep dive:** Study sections 11-17 of the analysis for advanced techniques

## üé® Design Philosophy Summary

Your original character sheet follows these core principles:

1. **Organic Shapes** - No harsh rectangles, everything has rounded corners
2. **Layered Depth** - Multiple shadow layers create realism
3. **Color Coding** - Consistent thematic colors for related elements
4. **Smooth Feedback** - Every interaction responds visually (0.4s transitions)
5. **Progressive Reveal** - Information appears on demand, not all at once
6. **Medieval Aesthetic** - Parchment textures, warm tones, traditional typography
7. **High Contrast** - Dark text on light backgrounds ensures readability
8. **Tactile Feel** - Hover states that make elements feel clickable/touchable

---

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### Do's
‚úÖ Keep the parchment aesthetic consistent across all pages
‚úÖ Use color themes to group related information
‚úÖ Animate entrances but keep transitions smooth (not jarring)
‚úÖ Maintain the 0.4s transition timing for cohesion
‚úÖ Use reveal mechanics sparingly (for secondary info only)
‚úÖ Scale elements on hover to indicate interactivity

### Don'ts
‚ùå Don't mix too many different animation speeds
‚ùå Don't use pure white or pure black (use cream and dark brown instead)
‚ùå Don't create rectangles without border-radius
‚ùå Don't add too many layers of shadow (3-4 max)
‚ùå Don't override the font family in random places
‚ùå Don't make everything wiggle/animate constantly

## üîÑ Future Enhancements

Ideas to expand on this foundation:

- [ ] Add dark mode variant (preserve parchment feel with darker palette)
- [ ] Create additional animation presets (bounce, rotate, pulse)
- [ ] Build a character creator tool (choose your own stats/skills)
- [ ] Develop additional components (progress bars, badges, tooltips)
- [ ] Create themed variations (sci-fi, modern, steampunk)
- [ ] Add print stylesheet for printer-friendly "character sheets"
- [ ] Build React/Vue component library based on these styles
